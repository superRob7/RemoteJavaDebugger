# Remote Java Debugger

This research project aimed to reduce the amount of time developers spend debugging their applications, by facilitating the ability for custom-built diagnostic scripts to automate the debugging process, locally or remotely.  Upon conclusion of the project, the finalised prototype offers the ability to:


1.Connect to a target debuggee via three means: 
..1. Launch  
...1. The connection specifics are gathered through the UI and the target debugger’s compiled file is then selected by a file picker
