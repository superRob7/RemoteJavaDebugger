# Remote Java Debugger

This research project aimed to reduce the amount of time developers spend debugging their applications, by facilitating the ability for custom-built diagnostic scripts to automate the debugging process, locally or remotely.  Upon conclusion of the project, the finalised prototype offers the ability to:
 
## Connect to a target debuggee via three means: 
* Launch  
  * The connection specifics are gathered through the UI and the target debuggerâ€™s compiled file is then selected by a file picker 
* Socket Attach 
  * The connection specifics are gathered through the UI and used to attempt the remote connection 
* Socket Listen 
  * The connection specifics are gathered through the UI and used to attempt the remote connection
